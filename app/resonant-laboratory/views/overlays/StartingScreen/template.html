        <p>Resonant Laboratory is a tool developed by Kitware, Inc. to help users
        build and share visualizations without needing to write code.</p>
        <p>This tool focuses on doing one thing, and doing it well: given a
        reasonably clean dataset, connect it to a visualization. Its
        architecture is designed to be flexible to a diverse array of dataset inputs, as well
        as new, state-of-the-art visualizations. However, we believe that problems
        like data reshaping and the process of designing custom visualizations
        are best dealt with elsewhere.</p>
