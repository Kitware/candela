Resonant Laboratory Text
========================

This file outlines most of the user-facing text in Resonant Laboratory.

*TODO: Ideally, we should convert this file into some kind of `en.json` file that the app actually uses for its text content (will make internationalization much easier).*

# Message Dialog Boxes
## About Dialog
TODO: The [template](../views/overlays/AboutResonantLab/template.html) definitely needs more text!

## Success Screens
Here is the [template](../views/layout/Overlay/successTemplate.html), and these are the messages that can go in the template:
- The dataset appears to have loaded correctly.
- You've wired up all the connections that the visualization needs. Well done!
- The visualization appears to be functioning correctly.

## Loading Screens
Here's the [template](../views/layout/Overlay/loadingTemplate.html), and these are the messages:
- Still accessing this project's datasets...
- Still accessing this project's matching settings...
- Still attempting to render the visualization...

## User Error Screens
The idea behind this screen is the user still needs to do something for something to work (the user should be able to fix these on their own). Here's the [template](../views/layout/Overlay/userErrorTemplate.html), and these are the messages, broken down by panels:

#### Dataset panel
- You have not chosen a dataset yet. Click [here](#) to choose one.
- There was a problem parsing the data; you\'ll probably need to [edit](#) or [reshape](#) the data in order to use it.
- There was a problem parsing the data. Specifically, we\'re having trouble understanding the dataset attributes (usually column headers); you\'ll probably need to [edit](#) or [reshape](#) the data in order to use it.

#### Matching panel
- You need to choose both a Dataset and a Visualization in order to connect them together.
- The visualization needs more connections to data in order to display anything.

#### Visualization panel
- You have not chosen a visualization yet. Click [here](#) to choose one.
- This visualization needs more data matchings. Make sure there are no orange warning triangles in the Matching panel.

## Regular Error Screens
The idea behind these screens is that some kind of error has happened, but it's one that we know about, and it's supposed to happen (the user may or may not be able to fix these on their own). Here's the [template](../views/layout/Overlay/errorTemplate.html), and these are the messages:
- You don\'t have the necessary permissions to delete that project.
- Sorry, you can\'t delete projects unless you [log in](#).
- The dataset could not be loaded; there is a good chance that there is a permissions problem.

## System Failure Screens
The idea behind these screens is something really bad happenedâ€”something that we didn't anticipate. So we have a [template](../views/layout/Overlay/reallyBadErrorTemplate.html), but the messages and details will probably be really cryptic.

# Control Dialog Boxes
These dialog boxes are a little more complex than simple messages.

# Menus and Buttons
TODO: These are short, and they shouldn't be hard to find... but an `en.json` file should still have entries for them.

# Empty State
TODO: We don't have much here yet; things like the matching panel should also have helpful text / maybe a legend to help orient the user and motivate them to try things.
- Try one of these buttons or bars to get started.
- Need a hand? Try the ? buttons.

# Notifications
These show up as little notifications in the bottom corner that the user can close, or they automatically fade after a while.
