Resonant Laboratory Text
========================

This file outlines the user-facing text in Resonant Laboratory.

*TODO: Ideally, we should convert this file into some kind of `en.json` file that the app actually uses for its text content (will make internationalization much easier).*

# Message Dialog Boxes
## Splash / About Dialog

Resonant Laboratory is a beta tool under active development by Kitware, Inc. to help users
build and share visualizations without needing to write code.
This tool focuses on doing one thing, and doing it well: given a
reasonably clean dataset, connect it to a visualization. Its
architecture is designed to be flexible to a diverse array of dataset inputs, as well
as new, state-of-the-art visualizations. However, we believe that problems
like data reshaping and the process of designing custom visualizations
are best dealt with elsewhere.

If you have those needs, check out other [Resonant applications](#) that we are developing to address these issues
independently. The Resonant platform includes both general solutions like
Resonant Laboratory, as well as highly specialized solutions developed for
our partners and customers.

Resonant Laboratory is brought to you by [Kitware](#), a leader in
innovative, open-source solutions to today's scientific computing and data
analytics challenges.

Resonant Laboratory is an open source project, released under the Apache
v2 License. The source code is available [on Github](#).

If something isn't working as it should, please [let us know](#). We want to get any problems fixed as soon as possible.
Is there something that this should be doing, but it's not? Do you have
an idea for how this could be improved? If so, we'd love to work with you
to build a [custom solution](#) that better fits your needs.


## Success Screens
#### Possible Messages:
- The dataset appears to have loaded correctly.
- You've wired up all the connections that the visualization needs. Well done!
- The visualization appears to be functioning correctly.

#### Always show:
- If something actually isn't working as it should, please [let us know](#). We want to get any problems fixed as soon as possible.
- Is there something that this should be doing, but it's not? Do you have an idea for how this could be improved? If so, we'd love to work with you to build a [custom solution](#) that better fits your needs.

## Loading Screens
#### Possible Messages:
- Still accessing this project's datasets...
- Still accessing this project's matching settings...
- Still attempting to render the visualization...

#### Always show:
- If you think it should have finished by now, please [let us know](#). If something is broken, we want to get it fixed as soon as possible.
- Or, it's totally possible that you're doing something awesome that we didn't anticipate (like using a huge dataset). If so, we'd love to work with you to build a [custom solution](#) that better fits your needs.

## User Error Screens
*The idea behind this screen is the user still needs to do something for something to work (the user should be able to fix these on their own). These are the possible messages, broken down by panels:*

#### Dataset panel
- You have not [chosen a dataset](#) yet.
- There was a problem parsing the data; you\'ll probably need to reshape the data in order to use it.
- There was a problem parsing the data. Specifically, we\'re having trouble understanding the dataset attributes (usually column headers); you\'ll probably need to reshape the data in order to use it.

#### Dataset settings dialog
- You don\'t have the necessary permissions to delete that project.
- Sorry, you can\'t delete projects unless you [log in](#).
- The dataset could not be loaded; there is a good chance that there is a permissions problem.

#### Matching panel
- You need to choose both a Dataset and a Visualization in order to connect them together.
- The visualization needs more connections to data in order to display anything.

#### Visualization panel
- You have not [chosen a visualization](#) yet.
- This visualization needs more data matchings. Make sure there are no orange circles in the Matching panel.

#### Always show:
- If it's not clear how to fix this, or if something else is wrong, [let us know](#). We want to get any problems fixed as soon as possible.
- Or, maybe it's not a bug, but a design problem. Is there something that this should be doing, but it's not? Do you have an idea for how this could be improved? If so, we'd love to work with you to build a [custom solution](#) that better fits your needs.

## System Failure Screens
*The idea behind these screens is something really bad happenedâ€”something that we didn't anticipate. So we have some default text, but we can't predict the message itself. It and its details will probably be really cryptic.*
#### Always show:
- I've made a huge mistake... (flaming banana stand icon)
- This is a problem we didn't anticipate. Please [let us know](#) that this happened.
