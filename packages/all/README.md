# ![](docs/static/favicon.png) Candela All

Candela All provides a single library containing all of the components and
mixins provided by the other Candela libraries. This library is suitable for
including directly in a webpage, or in any other setting where you don't want to
specify which parts of Candela you want to use.

Candela is an open-source framework for creating interoperable, reusable
visualization components for the web. Candela is a part of
[Kitware](http://www.kitware.com)'s [Resonant](http://resonant.kitware.com)
platform. Candela focuses on making scalable, rich visualizations available with
a normalized API for use in real-world data science applications.
