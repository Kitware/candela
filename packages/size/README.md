# ![](docs/static/favicon.png) Candela Core

Candela Size contains mixins for automatically handling changes in the size of
an element containing a Candela visualization (due to, e.g., browser window
resizing).

Candela is an open-source framework for creating interoperable, reusable
visualization components for the web. Candela is a part of
[Kitware](http://www.kitware.com)'s [Resonant](http://resonant.kitware.com)
platform. Candela focuses on making scalable, rich visualizations available with
a normalized API for use in real-world data science applications.
