Image testing
=============

One of Candela's testing phases is **image testing**, in which images of
visualization components are created programmatically and compared to
established baseline images. These images are automatically uploaded to
`Kitware's Girder
instance <https://data.kitware.com/#folder/576845848d777f30a28d705a>`_ where they
are catalogued by Travis build number and can be viewed by anyone.
