# [candela](../..#readme).[components](..#readme).BoxPlot

A boxplot. The visualization takes a set of measures (**fields**) and produces
a boxplot of each one. The optional **group** field will partition the data
into groups with matching value and make a boxplot (or set of boxplots)
for each group.
